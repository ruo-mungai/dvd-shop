# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

 Movie.create({ title: "Star Wars" })
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
